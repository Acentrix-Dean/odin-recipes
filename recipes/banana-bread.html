      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 quarter teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>3 quarter cup of brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 half cup of butter</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 and a third cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
          9x5-inch loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar
          and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until
          smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir
          banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter
          into the prepared loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
          comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 10
          minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
